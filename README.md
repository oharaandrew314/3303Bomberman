###Contribution Rules

Feel free to challenge my rules, or add your own.
It may look like there is a lot, but they're mostly just steps

- I don't really care about style nitpicking (as long as it's readable and using Windows/CRLF line-endings)
- Create feature branches for each feature (no personal development branches!)
  1. Create feature branch off dev (if it's related to a Github issue, put the issue # in branch name)
  2. Make commits
  3. Ensure tests pass
  4. Make a pull request to merge into dev
  5. Modify your branch to be mergeable if necessary
  6. If you modified someone else's code, have them review and merge
  7. If you didn't modify someone else's code, feel free to merge yourself
  8. Delete the feature branch, and pull dev
- Submitting milestones
  1. Wait until dev is stable and meets milestone requirements
  2. Make a pull request to merge dev into master
  3. Once everyone has reviewed, merge it
  4. Create a "Milestone X" branch off of master
  5. Merge master into dev
